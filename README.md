# LabResourceIndex
I've installed many web apps for my lab. Then I'd like to create a desktop-like, web app launcher to customizable urls to installed web apps using static html. Each icon has a clickable picture and a short description. So I created this. It may look ugly, but I hope it's useful for you.
